# StudyNotBoring - Game Edition

## Import/Export Feature

We've added a new import/export feature to help you manage your notes:

### Export Notes
1. Navigate to the "Notes" tab
2. Click the "Export Notes" button
3. Your notes will be downloaded as a JSON file named "study-not-boring-notes.json"

### Import Notes
1. Navigate to the "Notes" tab
2. Click the "Import Notes" button
3. Select a valid JSON file containing notes
4. The notes will be merged with your existing notes

The import feature will:
- Add new notebooks that don't already exist
- Add new notes to existing notebooks
- Skip notes that already exist (based on ID)
